** Lookup missing I18n translations **

This rake task takes all the locales in your Rails application and reports all the keys that are missing from
one or more locales. It can be useful when adding a new locale to an existing application or when checking the
integrity of an existing I18n translation set.

This version has two significant differences from the original one by Jakob Skjerning (https://github.com/koppen/i18n_missing_keys) and later improved by Geronimo Diaz (https://github.com/geronimod/i18n_missing_keys):

* it also fetches keys directly from the app/views directory
* it allows to report blank keys as missing
